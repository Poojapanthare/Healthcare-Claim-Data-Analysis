# Healthcare-Claim-Data-Analysis

Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:

a) Billing for services that were not provided. b) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service. c) Misrepresenting the service provided. d) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually provided. e) Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was not covered.

**Business Problem**

Many providers make false claims at the place of other beneficiaries so Insurance institutions are more vulnerable in healthcare fraud due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premium and as a result healthcare is becoming costly data by day.

Here, our task is to minimize the false claims by providers and to do so, we will have to provide a solution which will predict the potential fraudulent providers based on previous claims filed by them. Along with it, we will focus on discovering the important variables which help to detect the behaviour of potential fraudulent provers. And using this solution, we will be able to make the right decision for the false claims which will save the money from false claims and prevent the Insurance company from financial loss
